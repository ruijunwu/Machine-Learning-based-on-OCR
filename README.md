# Machine Learning based on OCR

```
Developed Machine Learning algorithm and classification on recognizing the characters in a picture
based on Python using Scikit-learn and Pandas.

Dealt with operation of matrix, image processing, noise elimanation and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

Able to detect the location of the words and convert them into machine-encoded text properly
and reach to 95% accuracy rate.

## Package

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
import numpy as np # use numpy to do array operations
import image
import os
import cv2
import math
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn import svm # use SVM method
```
